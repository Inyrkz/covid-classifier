# PneumoniaX
Building a flask app using deep learning to detect Covid 19 and Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images of Patients

Install the libraries in the `requirements.txt` file by running the code below.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The deep learning model is too large to be stored on Github. 
You'll have to retrain the model by running the codes in the `covidtrial.ipynb` notebook.

In the `app.py` file, change the code in line 4 to the name of your deep learning model.
